See https://adventofcode.com/ for further details.

## installation

Before you can run the project, you have to install the dependencies via:


```sh
npm install

```
(this requires NodeJS installed of course. Code is tested with an old-fashioned Node version 9 (and npm 5.6), no need for new fancy stuff )

## run script

In order to start the project, run:

```sh
npm start

```

Please note that you have to adjust the index.ts file to assure that you run the day you want. Just import the corresponding aocXX.ts file in the src folder. Usually the latest implemtented puzzle is used in the index.ts.

## todos

As AoC consumes plenty of time, especially if you want to implement nice solutions, this challenge conflicts with family. Nevertheless the goal is to at least think of the best possible solution, that's why this chapter collects all potential improvements of the checked in code to at least rework it as soon as I retire.
